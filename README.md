# **AI-Powered Document Data Extraction System for Weighbridge Slips**

This project is an **end-to-end OCR and reasoning pipeline** designed to extract structured data from weighbridge slip images.  
It uses **docTR** for high-accuracy OCR and **Qwen 3** for intelligent reasoning to produce clean JSON output.

## Features
- Extracts:
  - WB Vehicle No
  - Net Weight
  - Date
  - CID No
  - Lot No
  - Quantity
- Works with **JPG, PNG, PDF** files.
- Automatic **image preprocessing** (resize, deskew, denoise, convert to RGB).
- **REST API** built with FastAPI for easy integration.
- JSON output ready for database storage or further processing.
- Plug-and-play integration with enterprise platforms like **Nexial**.

## Workflow
1. **Upload**  
   User uploads a weighbridge slip image via API.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   OpenCV enhances image quality for better OCR results.

3. **OCR Extraction** *(docTR)*  
   - Detection model: `db_resnet50`  
   - Recognition model: `crnn_vgg16_bn`  
   - Produces layout-aware raw text.

4. **Reasoning & Structuring** *(Qwen 3)*  
   - Takes OCR text and extracts required fields using natural language instructions.  
   - Returns clean, structured JSON.

5. **Output**  
   API responds with extracted JSON and optional raw OCR text.
